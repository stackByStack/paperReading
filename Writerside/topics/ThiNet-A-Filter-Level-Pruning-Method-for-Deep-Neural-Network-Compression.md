# ThiNet: A Filter Level Pruning Method for Deep Neural Network Compression

<show-structure for="chapter,procedure" depth="3"/>

## Abstract
- we need to prune filters based on statistics information computed from **its next layer**, not the current layer,
which differentiates ThiNet from existing methods
